 ## Using CloakX
 
 The static analysis and modification of the extensions is performed by using `cloak.py` and providing a path to a directory of uncompressed extensions. 
 
 `cloakx/cloak.py extension_directory`
 
 The python script will process each extension performing static analysis on the droplets and renaming the war resources.
 
 The dynamic analysis is performed by running the following on the directory of an extension 
 
 `/onthefly_overwrite/patch_after_xhound.py extension`
